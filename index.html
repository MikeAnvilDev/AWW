                    <p>
                        Alabama Water Watch (<abbr title="Alabama Water Watch">AWW</abbr>) is a citizen volunteer, water quality monitoring program
                        covering all of the major river basins in Alabama. AWW is a part of the <a href="http://gww.aaes.auburn.edu/" target="_blank">
                            Global Water Watch
                        </a> network.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The AWW vision is to have a citizen monitor on every stream, river, lake and coast in Alabama. The goal of AWW is to
                        foster the development of statewide water quality monitoring by:

                        <li>
                            <b>Educating</b>
                            citizens on water issues in Alabama and the world
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Training</b>
                            citizens to use standardized equipment and techniques to gather credible water information using quality assurance protocols.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Empowering</b> citizens to make a positive impact by using their water monitoring data for environmental
                            education, waterbody restoration and protection, and involvement in watershed stewardship.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        AWW relocated from its old home in Upchurch Hall in the AU Fisheries Department and moved to the <i>Center for Advanced Science, Innovation and Commerce</i>
                        (<abbr title="Center for Advanced Science, Innovation and Commerce">CASIC</abbr> Building) in 2013 and became a program in the
                        <a href="http://aaes.auburn.edu/wrc/" target="_blank">AU Water Resources Center</a>. AWW receives support from multiple sources including the Alabama
                        Cooperative Extension System, the Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station, grants from various governmental and private agencies, and contributions
                        from individuals and groups throughout the state.

                        We invite you to take a few minutes to view AWW’s award winning video, produced in 1998 and digitally enhanced and updated in 2010

                        This video documents key individuals and efforts in the early days that provided a solid foundation for the formation of a highly-successful
                        statewide volunteer monitoring program, and updates of key success stories that have been built on this foundation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The success of AWW depends on the volunteerism and commitment of Monitoring Groups. Volunteers may participate in AWW by becoming certified
                        and regularly monitoring their waterbodies. They may also identify problems by analyzing data and taking action steps to resolve water quality
                        problems. Support to monitoring groups, the program and the association is funded, in part, through membership dues, gifts and services.
