                        <p>
                            The Exploring Our Living Streams Curriculum provides hands-on activities for teaching students about watershed 
                            science and water monitoring. The 4-H AWW Program provides support to clubs and classrooms as they use the 
                            curriculum and collect water data.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Exploring Alabama’s Living Streams has a flexible design to accommodate the unique needs 
                            and teaching styles of educators. That is accomplished by the following means:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            STRUCTURE: The curriculum is structured to be completed in about one week. Many concepts 
                            and ideas presented, however, are a natural platform for more in-depth investigation, or 
                            incorporation of additional science, math, and social studies concepts. The curriculum can 
                            therefore be used as a foundational guide for longer time periods by bringing in materials 
                            that complement classroom learning objectives.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            MATERIALS: Curriculum material is arranged in modules, which build on each other and culminate 
                            in a structured field trip. The "Exploration before Explanation"" concept can easily be adapted, 
                            if desired, by taking the field trip first, collecting data, then returning to learn about 
                            what was done and why.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ACTIVITIES: Four activities accompany each module. The difficulty and/or time commitment varies 
                            with activity. Educators can choose which activities best suit the abilities of the students 
                            and class goals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            WORKSHOPS: Three types of workshops are available for educators. The first two are the formal 
                            AWW Stream Biomonitoring and AWW Chemistry workshops. The third is a professional development 
                            workshop designed around the Living Streams curriculum. All three workshops carry Continuing 
                            Education credits. The professional development workshop also carries AMSTI credit. We recommend 
                            all three of these training workshops to get the most use out of the curriculum.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS: The curriculum is designed to use the help of local Alabama Water Watch 
                            volunteer monitors. A number of organizations are often available to work with science classrooms 
                            as well, including local Environmental Education (EE) centers. For more information see Linking 
                            to "Local Experts"" in the Community and Environmental Education Centers in Alabama.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ADAPTING TO ELEMENTARY GRADES: The curriculum targets middle and high school students; however, 
                            elementary students enjoy getting their feet wet as well. The Internet Resources section of the 
                            curriculum can help locate activities applicable for younger students.

                                        This Alabama Water Watch (AWW) Citizen Science Data Simulation (CSDS) provides students and other users,
                                        with interactive activities to learn about basic features such as online data entry and simple water data
                                        graphs to help citizens analyze and interpret the data collected by volunteer monitors. In addition to
                                        collecting data, data analysis and interpretation are key ingredients for successful watershed stewardship.
                                        AWW developed the CSDS considering that many monitors, including students, are intimidated by this aspect of
                                        citizen science, and therefore do not utilize the AWW Water Data Tools. Throughout the CSDS sessions, users
                                        will learn about water quality standards, optimum values for aquatic life, and tendencies for some of the
                                        water variables tested by AWW monitors.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The AWW CSDS was developed using a collection of real data collected by AWW volunteers from distinctive
                                        sites in order to create a variety of water quality conditions for a fictional watershed. The watershed
                                        includes streams, a lake and the coast. Water chemistry data (AWW water variables: air and water temperature,
                                        alkalinity, dissolved oxygen, hardness, pH, salinity, Secchi depth and turbidity) for a 30 month period is
                                        included in the CSDS database. The CSDS is especially helpful to monitoring groups that are just beginning
                                        to collect data and therefore do not have the multiple years of data needed to identify trends and abnormalities
                                        in water quality.

                            Resources Center in mid-2015. Dr. Srivastava put upgrading our websites and our database as top priorities, 
                            and thanks to his efforts and those of the good folks in ACES-Ag Information Technology and AU Communications 
                            and Marketing, and especial thanks to Sergio and Jim Johnson, whose long hours put in to upgrade the AWW 
                            database, things are looking good! As I said at our AWW Annual Meeting, we at AWW are lucky to have a person 
                            of Dr. Srivastava’s caliber (Butler-Cunningham Eminent Scholar in the College of Agriculture, Professor in 
                            the Department of Biosystems Engineering, Distinguished Engineer Award recipient from the Alabama Section of 
                            the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers) – he elevates all that we do – thanks Dr. S!

                            A major loss to the AWW Program was the loss of Miss Rita, AWW cat-herder extraordinaire – we continue to miss 
                            her. Initially, we thought that it was the onset of Armageddon, but thanks to our amazing staff, we survived! 
                            Special thanks to Miss Sydney Smith, who stepped in without hesitation to help fill the shoes of Miss Rita (note, Sydney is partial to E. coli 
                            see <a href="../../about-us/index.html#0_2" target="_blank">Program Staff</a>)

                        <p>
                            AWW conducted 98 workshops in the past year, thanks in large part to our dedicated citizen trainers! With 472 new 
                            water watchers on the ground, we will get even closer to realizing our vision of having a monitor on every stream, 
                            river, lake, bay and bayou in the state.

                            And thanks to support from the Alabama Cooperative Extension System and the work of Miss Mona through 4-H AWW, 
                            4,000 young Alabamians have learned about this state’s aquatic treasures and how to preserve and protect them.
