                                        The pH is a measure of the level of acidity or alkalinity of water or another solution. A pH of 7.0 is neutral.
                                        Values less than 7 are acidic, and those more than 7 are basic. Weak organic acids lower pH slightly. pH is affected
                                        by carbon dioxide (CO2) because CO2 in water forms a weak organic acid called carbonic acid. Strong mineral acids
                                        (e.g. sulfuric, nitric and hydrochloric acid) can lower the pH to lethal limits for aquatic life. The pH of water
                                        can change throughout a season or even within a day. The optimal pH range for aquatic life is 6.5 to 8.5 or 9.0.
                                        pH less than 4.0 or more than 11.0 is usually lethal to fish and other organisms. Natural waters reflect the pH of
                                        the soils that have come into contact with the water. Industrial, municipal or agricultural waters may have significantly
                                        higher or lower pH than natural waters. Decreases in pH could indicate acid rain, runoff from acid soils (e.g. acid
                                        mine drainage) or contamination from livestock waste.

                                        Hardness in water is primarily a measure of the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Limestone (CaCO3 or MgCO3) is a natural source of hardness. Animals and plants require calcium and magnesium for life.
                                        Calcium is an important component of cell walls, shells and bones of many aquatic organisms. Magnesium is a component
                                        of chlorophyll, which is necessary for photosynthesis in green plants. Hard water can cause problems by leaving scaly
                                        deposits in pipes and appliances, and decreasing the cleaning action of soap and detergent.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Unpolluted waters in Alabama usually have hardness values very similar to alkalinity values. Hardness of seawater
                                        is 6,000 mg/L or more.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Most fish and aquatic organisms live in waters with hardness between 15 and 200 mg/L. In waterbodies with hardness less
                                        than 15 mg/L or greater than 500 mg/L fish reproduction may be limited. Drinking water with hardness greater than
                                        350 mg/L can be harmful to humans.

                                        Alkalinity is a measure of the buffering capacity of water. Higher alkalinity in a body of water provides a “buffer”
                                        against changes in pH, making it more stable for aquatic life.

                                    <p>
                                        Limestone is a natural source of alkalinity. The chemical name of limestone is calcium carbonate (CaCO3) or magnesium
                                        carbonate (MgCO3). When limestone dissolves in water, carbonates and bicarbonates are produced, and alkalinity rises.
                                        If a waterbody has low alkalinity, it is susceptible to rapid changes in pH if acids or bases enter the water. Water
                                        with higher alkalinity usually has a higher pH.

                                        Alkalinity of natural waters in Alabama comes primarily from carbonates and bicarbonates leached from soil and rocks.
                                        Alkalinity values across Alabama range from 10 mg/L or less in parts of the Coastal Plain to 200 mg/L and more in
                                        regions with limestone formations and outcrops, such as in the Upper Coosa River Basin, the Black Belt and the Interior
                                        Plateau (Limestone County area). Brackish water or seawater typically has alkalinity of 100 to 125 mg/L.

                                        Temperature affects the physical and chemical properties of water and greatly influences aquatic organisms by
                                        affecting their feeding, reproduction, and metabolic rates. Temperature affects how much oxygen water can hold
                                        (see DO saturation page 48) and how quickly nutrients will cycle through the aquatic system.

                                    <p>
                                        Water can form layers (strata) of different temperatures in reservoirs, lakes and ponds. Water temperatures may be
                                        increased by discharges from industries or power generating plants. Runoff from heated impervious surfaces can also
                                        increase water temperatures. Thermal pollution is a problem in some streams and lakes. Stream water temperatures are
                                        often lower than air temperature because of groundwater inflows or shading by streamside vegetation. If the riparian
                                        vegetation is cleared, stream temperatures may be colder in winter and warmer in summer because of a loss of this
                                        buffer. Most aquatic organisms can tolerate gradual changes in temperature, but drastic changes can cause thermal
                                        stress. Temperatures above 32 °C may be lethal to many aquatic organisms. Some Antarctic fish die at temperatures
                                        above 4 °C.

                                            Biologically, when aquatic plants release oxygen during photosynthesis; this is usually the primary source of DO in lakes and oceans.

                                        Oxygen from the atmosphere enters water more readily through the action of wind and waves, or when water passes over 
                                        riffles or waterfalls. DO is naturally at least 10,000 times more concentrated in air than in water! Organic matter, 
                                        both natural and from pollution, can create high biological oxygen demands (BOD) and remove oxygen from water. This 
                                        may cause “fish kills” and otherwise alter aquatic organism communities. A DO value of at least 5.0 ppm is desirable 
                                        for most aquatic organisms, and is required for streams classified as “Fish and Wildlife” or higher. Dissolved oxygen 
                                        decreases with increasing temperature, so DO values are expected to be higher during the winter and lower during the 
                                        summer. Dissolved oxygen usually decreases with increasing depth, so DO values are expected to be higher at the surface 
                                        of a lake and lower toward the bottom.

                                        In lakes and ponds with high nutrient concentration DO can change dramatically throughout the day because of photosynthesis 
                                        by aquatic plants. Dissolved oxygen in water is higher in winter and lower in summer (opposite of temperature) because the 
                                        solubility of oxygen is greater in colder water.

                    <p>
                        Being a part of Alabama Water Watch (AWW), whether you are a monitor, a member of the AWW Association (AWWA), you work in 
                        the AWW office, or all of the above, means being part of a community that is dedicated to the same goal: protecting and 
                        restoring water quality in Alabama. As a community we should celebrate our successes, support each other in difficult 
                        situations, and learn from each others’ experiences. In an effort to encourage this type of a community for AWW we would 
                        like to publicize more stories about the individuals and groups that make up AWW. We want to show how monitors are using 
                        their data and how groups are working together with their communities to protect their water resources.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thanks to the data collected by citizen volunteers throughout the state, AWW is making a real difference in Alabama’s water 
                        quality. Many citizen volunteers monitor water quality at sites on streams, rivers, lakes, bays, or bayous faithfully every 
                        month for years. Some discover water quality problems, many do not. Whether or not a monitor unearths a water quality “smoking gun”, 
                        all water data collected by AWW-certified monitors are valuable. This is emphasized each time AWW staff analyze citizen and 
                        agency (ADEM, AU, USGS, etc.) data in preparation for a “data interpretation” presentation for an AWW Group. In these presentations, 
                        group efforts are highlighted, water quality data trends are summarized, watershed-level assessments are presented, and land-use 
                        relationships relative to water quality are examined.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Methods of assessing water quality problems vary. One way is to compare measurements to water quality standards set by EPA or 
                        by the state. Another way is to compare measurements to the water quality of another “reference” site that is considered 
                        “relatively pristine” or unimpacted. Thus it is valuable to have water quality measurements from waterbodies lying in the 
                        different geologic/soil regions of the state to provide reference water quality conditions for evaluating impacts. Also, several 
                        incidents of leaks or spills (sewage leaks, release of chlorinated swimming pool water, etc.) have been “caught “by regular 
                        monthly monitoring by citizen volunteer monitors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Monitors have used their data to bring about positive changes in their watersheds for many years. Each “Success Story” is unique 
                        and offers many lessons for other water quality monitors. By hearing these real life stories of taking data to action, it is 
                        hopeful that the water monitors throughout the state will be encouraged to strengthen monitoring efforts and be inspired to think 
                        creatively when faced with difficult water quality issues. AWW would like to highlight your group’s success stories and put them 
                        on our statewide “Map of Success”. We would also like to share helpful tips that you may have for water monitoring and making a 
                        difference in your community with other AWW groups. If you have a success story or helpful suggestion to share, you can contact 
                        the AWW office by phone or email. These stories can be about your personal experience, that of your group or another monitor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We look forward to hearing from you about your success story!
