                Alabama Water Watch has developed a suite of online tools for storing, retrieving, examining
                and exploring AWW water data. Citizen volunteer monitors, and the public, can access AWW
                <b>water chemistry and bacteriological monitoring data</b>, displayed as line graphs and bar graphs.
                The search can be done through either a map or table interface.
            </p>
            <p>
                By clicking the <i>Data by Table</i> link, you will be directed to a table with a
                list of sites that can be searched by one of the ten AWW Watersheds (as defined in the AWW Water
                Chemistry and Bacteriological training manuals;
                <a href="http://www.alabamawaterwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2015/12/theAWWsiteCode.pdf" target="_blank">click here</a>
                for a review of AWW watersheds). You will notice that the <i>Alabama</i> River Watershed is displayed,
                by default, since it is the first based on alphabetic order.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, select the type of water data, Bacteria or Water Chemistry, that you want to view in the
                <b>Data Type</b> box at the top of the page.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, select the desired <i>AWW Watershed</i>, and then the desired AWW monitoring <i>Group</i> in that watershed.
            </p>
            <p>
                A table listing all of the monitoring sites for that group will be displayed. Note, if you don’t see a
                known site displayed that you are looking for, it is because there is no data at that site for the data type
                that you chose. For instance, if you select <i>Bacteria</i> for your Data Type, go to the <i>Watershed</i> and
                <i>Group</i> that you are looking for and don’t see the site, this means that there is <i>Water Chemistry</i> data
                for that site, but no <i>Bacteria</i> data – just go back to the top of the page and switch to <i>Water Chemistry</i>
                data to explore data for that site.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <i>Site Maps</i> icon opens a google map displaying the selected monitoring site in the center, The <i>Site Photos</i> 
                icon opens a window with any photos that have been uploaded of the site.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note: Water data can also be searched by Hydrologic Unit Code, or HUC, Watersheds (
                <a href="https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/huc.html" target="_blank">click here</a> to learn more about USGS watershed categorization
                based on HUCs). To search based on HUC watersheds, up at the top of the page next to <b>Search</b>, click the
                <i>HUC Watersheds radio button</i>, then select the desired <i>HUC6 Basin</i> and within that basin, the desired <i>HUC10 Watershed.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                As in the past, users have the option to graph either a single water quality variable, or two variables, by selecting the
                variable(s) on the drop-down boxes next to <b>Y1</b> or <b>Y2</b>. The scale on both axes can be adjusted by clicking on
                the <b>Y1</b> or <b>Y2</b> icons and then inputting the desired minimum and maximum values on each Y axis. Data ranges can
                be adjusted to the desired time frame desired by selecting dates in the boxes to the right of <b>From</b> and <b>To</b>.
                Click the <b>Chart</b> button to update changes, and the <b>Back to Sites</b> button to return to the list of sites.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another option to explore the AWW citizen data is searching monitoring sites by watershed using <a href="map.html">the watershed map</a>.
                This option allows the user to search by any one of the traditional ten major river basins used in the AWW site code system.
            </p>
            <p>
                We hope that AWW online data visualization becomes a valuable tool in your outreach, education, and watershed stewardship efforts!
